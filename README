OPML planets

This is a set of scripts, makefiles, xslt stylesheets to break down
some common planets into individual feeds, in an OPML outline.

You can use it to subscribe to a planet's feeds in a feed reader all at once,
then tweak the subscriptions. Some feed readers (only tested with google
reader) will interpret tags in the outline, so that feeds from one planet
can be grouped together.

Known dependencies:
sudo aptitude install xmlstarlet tidy make wget
